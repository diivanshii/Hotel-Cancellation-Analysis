# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

This project analyzes hotel booking data to understand the factors contributing to booking cancellations and provides recommendations on how cancellation rates can be lowered. The dataset includes various booking details such as room type, guest information, and reservation status.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains booking information for hotels, including:
- **Hotel type**: Resort or City Hotel
- **Is Canceled**: Indicates whether the booking was canceled (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Arrival Date**: Year, month, and day of arrival
- **Guest Details**: Number of adults, children, and babies
- **Country**: Country of origin of the guest
- **Room Information**: Reserved and assigned room types
- **Reservation Status**: Date of reservation and room status (Desired/Undesired)
- **Guest Type**: Couples, Singles, etc.

## Key Insights

### 1. Room Assignment Accuracy
A mismatch between the reserved room type and the assigned room type contributes to guest dissatisfaction and increases the likelihood of cancellations. Ensuring that guests receive their desired room type can significantly lower cancellation rates.

### 2. Personalized Communication
The dataset includes guest names and emails, allowing for personalized communication strategies. Sending tailored email reminders, promotional offers, or flexible rebooking options to guests can help reduce last-minute cancellations.

### 3. Flexible Cancellation Policies
By analyzing the cancellation patterns based on factors like guest type (Couples, Singles), origin country, or room status, hotels can design flexible cancellation policies to retain more bookings. For example, offering free cancellations to high-risk groups can prevent no-shows.

### 4. Improving Guest Satisfaction
Guests assigned to "Undesired" rooms (i.e., rooms they did not request) are more likely to cancel. By improving room assignment processes or offering early room upgrade options, cancellations can be minimized.

## Recommendations to Lower Cancellation Rates

1. **Improve Room Allocation Process**: Ensure that the reserved room type matches the assigned room type, reducing cancellations due to room dissatisfaction.
   
2. **Targeted Email Campaigns**: Use guest email addresses to send pre-arrival reminders, personalized offers, and promotions to secure bookings.

3. **Guest-Centric Cancellation Policies**: Adjust cancellation policies based on guest types and the likelihood of cancellations. Flexible policies for specific guest types can lower the overall cancellation rate.

4. **Monitor Booking Patterns**: Continuously monitor guest satisfaction and cancellation trends across various booking groups (country, guest type) to further optimize operations.
